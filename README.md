We can see a positive correlation between steps and calories burned. As assumed the more steps walked the more calories may be burnt.

we can see there is no clear relation between minutes slept and steps walked.

This graph clearly indicates the highly acyive usertype falls sleep easily (lowest awake time)and the sedentary usertype falls takes much time to fall asleep(highest awake time). Thus the graph clearly shows a correlation between usertype and awake time(the more the activity ,the less time to fall asleep).

The graph clearly indicates the users are most active during 5 to 7 pm (evening time).


# Conclusion / Act 
MY Conclusion on the analysis:
As there is a positive correlation between total steps taken and calories burnt ,we can add an indicator in the app showing the calories burnt for daily steps taken thus encouraging users to walk .

We can create an activity based Reward System.Users can collect reward points for each activity and after achieving a specific milestone ,the company can reward the user with gift hampers thus encouraging users to do more activity.

We can send notification on the app reminding users to sleep on time .

The app should be designed in a way that it shows the benefit of activity on sleeping pattern and stress level.

As users are more active during evening,we can send notification in evening about the benefits of walk and the effect it has on overall health of the user encouraging them to take a walk.

We can add some fitness related podcasts and exercise,yoga videos to the app. .
