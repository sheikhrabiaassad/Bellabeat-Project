# Conclusion / Act 
MY Conclusion on the analysis:
As there is a positive correlation between total steps taken and calories burnt ,we can add an indicator in the app showing the calories burnt for daily steps taken thus encouraging users to walk .

We can create an activity based Reward System.Users can collect reward points for each activity and after achieving a specific milestone ,the company can reward the user with gift hampers thus encouraging users to do more activity.

We can send notification on the app reminding users to sleep on time .

The app should be designed in a way that it shows the benefit of activity on sleeping pattern and stress level.

As users are more active during evening,we can send notification in evening about the benefits of walk and the effect it has on overall health of the user encouraging them to take a walk.

We can add some fitness related podcasts and exercise,yoga videos to the app. .
